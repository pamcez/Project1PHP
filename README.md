# Project1PHP
PHP Ranking System

##OVERVIEW
This is a website design for parents with kids under 5’s. Their kids go to a day care,
preschool, childcare centres or kindergarten. The existing NZ websites such as
under5s, Childcare Advisory and Ministry of Education ERO report; doesn’t have the
feature of parents rating system based on their experience. There is a need to rate 
these childcare centres and make this information available to the public. If we can 
find time rating hotels, restaurants and camp sites. I think that its about time to 
rate the childcare centres and preschools too.
This design will have some features of childcare.co.uk, Rate My Teacher, and
mychild.gov.au; plus the Ranking System.

##OBJECTIVE
The objective of this website is to empower the parents, improve the childcare
services and provide an unbiased, and honest ratings of childcare in New Zealand.

##FEATURES
Parents are able to register in the website and give rating to a particular centre or
childcare. The ratings will be from 10 to 0. Wherein 10 is the highest and 0 is the
lowest (unacceptable). If the rating is from 0 to 3, there is an option for the
parents to give an explanation. This explanation will not be shown in the website
itself but will be sent to the Ministry of Education for proper investigation.
Childcare Institution with the highest rating will be featured every month. They
will be awarded with their own brag page in the website to advertise and share
their tips, and secret to their success.
